## 🧭 About This Portfolio

Welcome to my **Infrastructure & Cloud Engineering Portfolio** — a collection of projects showcasing how I design, secure, and automate resilient IT environments.  

With over **20 years of experience** across **mining, finance,telecoms and managed service environments**, I specialize in:
- **Hybrid Cloud & Virtualization** (Azure, VMware, Hyper-V)  
- **Platform Modernization** (Windows Server, HPE/Dell Compute, Veeam)  
- **Security & Network Optimization** (FortiGate, SonicWall, IDS/IPS, VPN)  
- **Automation & Continuity** (PowerShell, Terraform, ITIL-based DR)  

Each project below highlights my hands-on work — from infrastructure rebuilds to DR automation and high-availability configurations.
